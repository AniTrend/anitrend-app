# __Known Bugs (v0.9.9)__
- __Trailer YouTube player will cause crashes if the activity is destroyed before it finishes loading, a bit difficult fix, but I'll see what I can do about that :) assuming that is even possible__
- __~~Authentication issues if the app has been inactive for some time~~ (Fixed in v0.9.9r8)__
- __Occasional crashes due to some misconfigurations should be resolved in revision 4__
- __~~If device is idle for a long time the application service crashes due to a caching mechanism that return a null value for the token (Fix is on the way, just needs more testing)~~__
- __~~Notifications do not get triggered according to sync preferences that were set~~__
- __~~Smart progress increment not working for manga~~__
- __~~Broken infinite scrolling for home pages, loss of scroll position when liking activities~~__
- __~~Newly registered without any content will experience crashes: Work around, go to Anilist and at least one completed anime with a score. Wait for a while for the server to reflect changes in the API~~__
- __~~After v0.7 of the app the Floating action button doesn't reappear while scrolling up, caused by *Design Support Library 25.1.0*~~__
- __~~Logout causes application to crash in version v0.8.5~~__
